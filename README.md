# Titanic-Prediction-Project
This project is a classic machine learning task based on the Titanic dataset provided by Kaggle. The goal is to build a predictive model that answers the question: “What sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc.).
